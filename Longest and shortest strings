Query the two cities in STATION with the shortest and longest CITY names, as well as their respective lengths (i.e.: number of characters in the name). If there is more than one smallest or largest city, choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically.


SQL Server Answer

SELECT TOP 1 CITY,LEN(CITY) 
FROM STATION 
ORDER BY LEN(CITY) ASC, CITY ASC;

SELECT TOP 1 CITY,LEN(CITY) 
FROM STATION 
ORDER BY LEN(CITY) DESC, CITY ASC;

MySQL
SELECT CITY,LENGTH(CITY) AS City_len
FROM STATION 
ORDER BY City_len ASC, CITY ASC
LIMIT 1;

SELECT CITY,LENGTH(CITY) AS City_len
FROM STATION 
ORDER BY City_len DESC, CITY ASC
LIMIT 1;
