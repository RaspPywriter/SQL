<h1>SQL</h1>
This is a list of different queries I've done using SQL. I worked throught the SQL Zoo exercises and I did a variety of queries on the Sakila database that comes with MySQL Workbench.

Check out the wiki where I'm going through examples using MySQL, Oracle, DB2, PostgreSQL, SQL. Looking at how they are different/the same.
